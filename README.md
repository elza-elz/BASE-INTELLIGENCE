# BASE-INTELLIGENCE
This project develops an ai agent using Streamlit,  LangChain, and Ollamaâ€™s Llama 3.2 and Llama 3.3 to  automate the generation of User stories, Use Cases ,Test Cases and Code from Business Requirement Documents (BRDs),  improving efficiency in the software development lifecycle. It is designed to automate the generation of use cases, test cases, and corresponding code from a Business Requirements Document (BRD). Users can upload BRD files in PDF, DOCX, or TXT formats, and the system extracts the relevant requirements. It then generates user stories, use cases, test case scenarios, and test cases based on the extracted content. Additionally, the project provides a functionality to generate error-free code implementing the use case and validates it against test cases. Finally, it allows users to download the generated documents, including code, test cases, and use cases, as a PDF.
